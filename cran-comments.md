## Re-submission

This is a re-submission. In this version I have:

* Incremented the version number to avoid confusion.
* Added one reference in the Description field of the DESCRIPTION file.
* Replaced \dontrun{} by \donttest{} to skip R CMD check for speed.

## Test environments

* local: windows 10 x64 (R 3.6.0)
* travis: ubuntu 14.04 (R 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, oldrel, release, devel)
* win-builder (R devel and release)
* rhub: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0 (R release)

## R CMD check results
