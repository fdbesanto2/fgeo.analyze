The goal of __fgeo.analyze__ is to analyze fgeo data.

## Installation

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("forestgeo/fgeo.analyze")
```

Or [install all **fgeo** packages in one step](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/index.html#installation).

For details on how to install packages from GitHub, see [this article](https://goo.gl/dQKEeg).

## Example

```{r}
library(fgeo)
```

### Abundance

Your data may have multiple stems per treeid and even multiple measures per
stemid (if trees have buttresses).

```{r}
# Trees with buttresses may have multiple measurements of a single stem. 
# Main stems have highest `HOM`, then largest `DBH`.
vft <- tribble(
  ~CensusID, ~TreeID, ~StemID, ~DBH, ~HOM,
          1,     "1",   "1.1",   88,  130,
          1,     "1",   "1.1",   10,  160,  # Main stem
          1,     "2",   "2.1",   20,  130,
          1,     "2",   "2.2",   30,  130,  # Main stem
)
```

Fundamentally, `abundance()` counts rows. All of these results are the same:

```{r}
nrow(vft)
dplyr::count(vft)
dplyr::summarize(vft, n = n())
abundance(vft)
```

But that result is likely not what you expect. Instead, you likely expect this:

```{r}
summarize(vft, n = n_distinct(TreeID))
```

As shown above, you can get a correct result by combining `summarize()` and `n_distinct()` (from the __dplyr__ package). But `abundance()` includes some useful additional features (see `?abundance()`). This code conveys your intention more clearly, i.e. to calculate tree abundance by counting the number of main stems:

```{r}
(main_stems <- pick_main_stem(vft))
abundance(main_stems)
```

If you have data from multiple censuses, then you can compute by census (or any other group).

```{r}
vft2 <- tibble::tribble(
  ~CensusID, ~TreeID, ~StemID, ~DBH, ~HOM,
          1,     "1",   "1.1",   10,  130,
          1,     "1",   "1.2",   20,  130,  # Main stem
          2,     "1",   "1.1",   12,  130,
          2,     "1",   "1.2",   22,  130   # Main stem
)
by_census <- group_by(vft2, CensusID)
(main_stems_by_census <- pick_main_stem(by_census))
abundance(main_stems_by_census)
```

Often you will need to first subset data (e.g. by `status` or `DBH`) and then count.

```{r}
over20 <- filter(main_stems_by_census, DBH > 20)
abundance(over20)
```

### Basal area

If trees have buttresses, then you may need to pick the main stemid of each stem so you do not count the same stem more than once.

```{r}
vft3 <- tribble(
  ~CensusID, ~TreeID, ~StemID, ~DBH, ~HOM,
          1,     "1",   "1.1",   88,  130,
          1,     "1",   "1.1",   10,  160,  # Main stem
          1,     "2",   "2.1",   20,  130,
          1,     "2",   "2.2",   30,  130,  # Main stem
          2,     "1",   "1.1",   98,  130,
          2,     "1",   "1.1",   20,  160,  # Main stem
          2,     "2",   "2.1",   30,  130,
          2,     "2",   "2.2",   40,  130,  # Main stem
)
(main_stemids <- pick_main_stemid(vft3))
main_stemids
basal_area(main_stemids)
```

`basal_area()` also allows you to compute by groups.

```{r}
by_census <- group_by(main_stemids, CensusID)
basal_area(by_census)
```

But if you want to compute on a subset of data, then you need to pick the data first.

```{r}
ten_to_twenty <- filter(by_census, DBH >= 10, DBH <= 20)
basal_area(ten_to_twenty)
```

### Abundance and basal area aggregated by year

Example data.

```{r}
vft <- example_byyr
vft
```

Abundance by year.

```{r}
abundance_byyr(vft, DBH >= 10, DBH < 20)
abundance_byyr(vft, DBH >= 10)
```

Basal area by year.

```{r}
basal_area_byyr(vft, DBH >= 10)
```

### Demography

```{r}
census1 <- fgeo.x::tree5
census2 <- fgeo.x::tree6
```

Demography functions output a list that you can convert to a more convenient dataframe with `to_df()`.

```{r}
recruitment_ctfs(census1, census2)
to_df(
  recruitment_ctfs(census1, census2, quiet = TRUE)
)
```

Except if you use `split2`: This argument creates a complex data structure that `to_df()` cannot handle.

```{r, error=TRUE}
not_recommended <- recruitment_ctfs(
  census1, census2, 
  split1 = census1$sp, 
  split2 = census1$quadrat, 
  quiet = TRUE
)
# Errs
to_df(not_recommended)
```

Instead, pass the multiple grouping variables to `split` via `interaction()`. This approach allows you to use any number of grouping variables and the output always works with `to_df()`.

```{r}
# Recommended
sp_quadrat <- interaction(census1$sp, census1$quadrat)
recruitment <- recruitment_ctfs(
  census1, census2, 
  split1 = sp_quadrat, 
  quiet = TRUE
)
to_df(recruitment)
```

The same applies for other demography functions.

```{r}
to_df(mortality_ctfs(census1, census2, split1 = sp_quadrat, quiet = TRUE))
growth <- to_df(growth_ctfs(census1, census2, split1 = sp_quadrat, quiet = TRUE))
growth
```

A simple way to separate the grouping variables is with `tidyr::separate()`.

```{r}
tidyr::separate(
  growth, 
  groups, into = c("species", "quadrats")
)
```

### Species-habitat associations

```{r}
tree <- fgeo.data::luquillo_tree5_random
elevation <- fgeo.data::luquillo_elevation
# Pick alive trees, of 10 mm or more
census <- filter(tree, status == "A", dbh >= 10)
# Pick sufficiently abundant species
pick <- filter(add_count(census, sp), n > 50)
species <- unique(pick$sp)
# Use your habitat data or create it from elevation data
habitat <- fgeo_habitat(elevation, gridsize = 20, n = 4)
# A list or matrices
tt_lst <- tt_test(census, species, habitat)
tt_lst
# A simple summary to help you interpret the results
summary(tt_lst)
# A combined matrix
Reduce(rbind, tt_lst)
# A dataframe
to_df(tt_lst)
```

## READ AND DELETE THIS SECTION

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
